## About

Dutch's Famous Strawberry Lemonade is a project aimed at promoting the love for strawberry lemonade. It features a collection of recipes, stunning product images, and a delightful user experience.

This project started as my very first webpage ever on November 27, 2022! The initial version of the website was created with HTML only and had a basic layout. Over time, I added styling to the page using CSS, including a color scheme that complemented the content. Finally, I added JavaScript to create interactivity on the website, such as a pop-up window when the "Recipes" button is clicked. It's amazing to see how far I've come since then.
