## Dutch's Famous Strawberry Lemonade

Welcome to the README for Dutch's Famous Strawberry Lemonade Website! This website showcases a refreshing drink enjoyed by many. It provides information about the drink, its recipe, and alternative ingredients.

## Evolution of the Code

This project started as my very first webpage ever on November 27, 2022! The initial version of the website was created with HTML only and had a basic layout. Over time, I added styling to the page using CSS, including a color scheme that complemented the content. Finally, I added JavaScript to create interactivity on the website, such as a pop-up window when the "Recipes" button is clicked. It's amazing to see how far I've come since then.
